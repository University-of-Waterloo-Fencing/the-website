      When and how did you start fencing?<br>
      When I was 10, I was looking for a new sport. Being captivated by knights at the time, I gave fencing a shot. At my very first practice I realized that it was nothing like swordfighting, but I immediately fell in love with the sport. I have been fencing competitively ever since, and have recently also started coaching.<br><br>
      Why do you like fencing?<br>
      I adore the combination of high-speed problem solving with explosive athleticism that fencing provides. The competitive aspect of facing one opponent whom is trying to outsmart your every move is thrilling. And of course it wouldn't be the same without the awesome energy we have within our teams and in the club overall!<br><br>
      What is your go-to tournament snack?<br>
      My favourite snacks during tournaments are cashews, bananas, and 'eierkoeken'
