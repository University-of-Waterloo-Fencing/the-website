  Beginners meet once a week for an introductory program geared towards people with no experience. There are 3 disciplines of weapons but we begin with foil to better teach basic techniques such as point control and priority. We focus on footwork, simple attacks/defenses, and proper form throughout the course. This culminates in a friendly end-of-term tournament before trying other disciplines (sabre, epee) to end off the semester.

  This membership is for those who have already taken the introductory course or can perform basic drills with minimal guidance. We meet for three hours twice a week throughout the term, with exceptions for special events hosted by the university such as large competitions, exams, and convocation.
  <br><br>
  Everybody begins with a basic warm-up and half an hour of general footwork. We then split by weapon type into a rotation of focuses for an hour which consists of either technical drills, physical training, or structured bouting. Every session then ends with open fencing to hone your skills or practice new techniques.

  The University of Waterloo has a varsity fencing team, which competes at the Ontario University Athletics (OUA) championships held every February/March. For the OUAs, each University can send a maximum of 4 athletes per weapon and gender. To be eligible, an athlete must be a full-time student or on an approved coop term. We do not hold formal tryouts for the varsity team; rather, coaching staff makes the top 4 selection from the roster of eligible athletes to represent the University. Selection is based on several factors such as performance at open tournaments, commitment at practice, and general sportsmanship.​
  <br><br>
  At the University of Waterloo, varsity athletes are required to complete several online training modules mandated by the University and OUA. Additionally, first time team members are also required to pay a rookie fee and get a physical performed by a physician. Varsity team members are expected to obtain a general club membership and attend all practices, unless an alternate arrangement has been discussed with a coach.​
  <br><br>
  Benefits to varsity status include preferred acceptance for incoming students, in-season physiotherapy, tutoring, consideration for athletic-specific scholarships, Physical Activities Complex locker, and the ability to represent the University of Waterloo at OUA championships.​
