  The University of Waterloo has a varsity fencing team, which competes at several tournaments during the year. We offer preferred acceptance for incoming students, in-season physiotherapy, tutoring, consideration for athletic-specific scholarships, gym locker, and the ability to represent the University of Waterloo at OUA championships.â€‹ To be eligible, an athlete must be a full-time student or on an approved coop term. Selection is based on several factors such as performance at competitions, commitment at practice, and general sportsmanship.

  We have accumulated a long list of achievements thanks to our dedicated fencers. If you have what it takes to be a Waterloo Warrior, let us know you're interested by contacting us to join the Varsity Fencing Team!
