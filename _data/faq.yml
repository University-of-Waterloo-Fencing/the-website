- question: WHO CAN JOIN THIS CLUB?
  answer: Anyone who is a student, alumni, or employee of the University of Waterloo may join. You must have a valid gym membership with the school, so alumni and staff must purchase one through the PAC before they can purchase a club membership. We are unfortunately not able to offer classes to the general public including children, anyone who isn't affiliated with the school is welcome to check out <a href="https://excelsiorfencing.ca/">Excelsior Fencing</a>.
- question: DO I NEED EXPERIENCE TO JOIN?
  answer: Nope! Beginners are more than welcome. Our members range from beginners to competitive fencers.
- question: DO I NEED TO BRING MY OWN EQUIPMENT?
  answer: You do NOT need to bring your own equipment. We supply new members with masks, gloves, weapons, and fencing jackets to successfully complete the course. Members are also able to rent equipment for practice or special-use cases such as tournaments.  
- question: WHAT SHOULD I BRING TO SESSIONS?
  answer: We recommend you wear athletic pants, a t-shirt, indoor court/running shoes, and bring a water bottle. The club has everything else!
- question: ARE ALL WEAPONS WELCOME?
  answer: Absolutely! We have experienced fencers in all three weapons. All beginners start with foil, but are exposed to sabre and epee by the end of the program.
- question: IS FENCING A SAFE SPORT?
  answer: Yes, fencing is one of the safest sports to participate in. Most injuries come from general physical activity and very few from actually being hit, all of our gear is rated to withstand up to 350 Newtons of force. 
- question: WHERE ARE THE SESSIONS HELD?
  answer: Our sessions take place at the PAC in the Activity Area, located on the top floor across from the Warrior Zone and overlooking the main gym.
